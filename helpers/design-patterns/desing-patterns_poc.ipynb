    "- The Factory Pattern is an Interface that defers the creation of the final object to a subclass.\n",
    "- The Factory pattern is about inserting another layer/abstraction between instantiating an object and where in your code it is actually used.\n",
    "- It is unknown what or how many objects will need to be created until runtime.\n",
    "- You want to localize knowledge of the specifics of instantiating a particular object to the subclass so that the client doesn't need to be concerned about the details.\n",
    "- You want to create an external framework, that an application can import/reference, and hide the details of the specifics involved in creating the final object/product.\n",
    "- The unique factor that defines the Factory pattern, is that your project now defers the creation of objects to the subclass that the factory had delegated it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall **the Factory Pattern is really about adding that extra abstraction between the object creation and where it is used**. This gives you extra options that you can more easily extend in the future.\n",

    "- **Creator**: The Factory class. Declares the Factory method that will return the object requested from it.\n",
    "- **Concrete Product**: The object returned from the Factory. The object implements the Product interface.\n"
